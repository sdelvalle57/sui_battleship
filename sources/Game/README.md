# Game Module Implementation Instructions

This document outlines the detailed steps required to implement the Game Module. The module will manage game request initiation, acceptance, cancellation, and resolution. It will also integrate a mock coinflip mechanism to simulate game outcomes and support direct invitations with the ability for players to engage in multiple concurrent games.

## 1. Game Request Management

### 1.1. Initiate Game Request
- **Function Name:** `initiateGameRequest`
- **Inputs:** 
  - Initiator ID
  - (Optional) Opponent ID (for direct invitations)
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Create a new game request with a unique identifier.
  - Set the initial game state to `pending`.
  - Record essential details such as player IDs, timestamp, and game metadata.

### 1.2. Accept Game Request
- **Function Name:** `acceptGameRequest`
- **Inputs:**
  - Game request ID
  - Accepting player ID
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Validate that the game request is in the `pending` state.
  - Update the game status to `active` upon successful acceptance.
  - Optionally, assign player roles or any other game-specific configurations.

### 1.3. Cancel Game Request
- **Function Name:** `cancelGameRequest`
- **Inputs:**
  - Game request ID
  - Requesting player ID (initiator or opponent)
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Ensure the game request is still in a cancellable state (`pending`).
  - Mark the game request as `cancelled`.
  - Inform all involved players about the cancellation.

### 1.4. Resolve Game Request
- **Function Name:** `resolveGameRequest`
- **Inputs:**
  - Game request ID
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Check that the game is in an `active` state.
  - Invoke the mock coinflip mechanism to simulate a game outcome.
  - Record the result (e.g., win/loss) and update the game status to `resolved`.
  - Optionally, update player statistics or any game logs.

## 2. Mock Coinflip Mechanism

### 2.1. Coinflip Function
- **Function Name:** `coinflip`
- **Inputs:** None
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Generate a random outcome (e.g., "heads" or "tails").
  - Return the outcome, which will be used to determine the winner in game resolution.

## 3. Support for Direct Invitations and Multiple Concurrent Games

### 3.1. Direct Invitations
- **Requirements:**
  - Enable players to send game invitations directly to one another.
  - Bypass the need for an automated matchmaking process when a direct invitation is sent.
  - Maintain a record of direct invitations and manage their state similarly to game requests.

### 3.2. Multiple Concurrent Games per Player
- **Requirements:**
  - Allow each player to participate in multiple games simultaneously.
  - Ensure every game session is uniquely identifiable.
  - Isolate the state and progress of each game to prevent cross-interference between concurrent sessions.

## 4. Additional Implementation Considerations

- **Error Handling:**
  - Validate game state transitions (e.g., accepting a game that is not pending, or cancelling an already resolved game).
  - Provide meaningful error messages for unauthorized actions or invalid state transitions.

- **Notifications:**
  - Optionally integrate a notification system to update players about changes (e.g., game started, cancelled, resolved).

- **Testing:**
  - Write comprehensive unit tests for each function (initiation, acceptance, cancellation, resolution, and coinflip).
  - Test concurrent game handling to ensure isolation between sessions.

- **Scalability & Maintainability:**
  - Document the code for each function to ease future modifications.
  - Structure the module to support potential future enhancements (e.g., advanced game logic replacing the coinflip mechanism).
